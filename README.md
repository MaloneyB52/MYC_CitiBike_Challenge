# NYC_CitiBike_Challenge

Screen shots attached (also tabbed and lableled in Tableau Public files. Citi_BikeStory_Module_Challenge)


Average Trip Duration Tab: This screen shot shows that the avearage bike rental time is less than one hour, that leads us to believe that CitiBike is mainly uised for commuting to jobs or to recreation. Both are in adundance in Iowa and should lend itself to replication. This data point leads us to believe that further study into communting in Iowa is needed to draw correlations.

Weekday Heat Map: This data, seen in this screen shot, lends further creedance to the commuting idea. Since the heat map clearly shows the weekdays are the high time for CitiBike, it lends greater evidence to workday commuting vice weekend leisure.

Gender Breakdown Tab: Surprisingly, ridership was greater among men than women. We do not see this as a major factor in determining investement, but perhaps shows room to grow as one half of your market may be underperforming, We believe targeted marketing to female ridership can close this gap<img width="2240" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-15 at 11 15 34 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88695150/149629169-2dc67fe9-06d8-434e-a9a1-930c69255439.png">


Customer Tab/: We further recommend focusing on a subscriber model. Especially since NYC can tap in to a large tourism community, yet still the subscriber model dominates. The customer model by definition means that riders are temporary and that CitiBike use is haphazard, intermittent and not part of a routine. Since Des Moines has no tourism to cmpare to NYC, and mainly a commuter population, we see that this disoparity will poonly be greater in Iowa and focus should be on the Subscriber model

Starting Locations Tab and Ending Location Tab: We compared starting locations with ending locations and the dats shows that bikes almost exlusively stay in the borough and rarely go more than a few miles.

Age Tab: Not surperisingly, most ridership was done in within the age groups of commuters and age of the workforce. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: Focus on the commuting public, using a subscriber model, and run tests to place bikes in areas of commuter domiciles and main business locations
